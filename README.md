# **currencyConveterJava **

This small personal project is for me to have some idea on developing a desktop GUI java program that connnects to an API and a database.

** ## Project Description **

** ### Fetching of Data **

The program first connects to a free currency converter API to fetch the current and yesterday's exchange rates for 11 main foreign currencies used here in the Philippines.

** ### Solve For Movement **

Then the program will solve for the difference of the current and yesterdays exchange rate.

** ### Display the Data **

The program will then display in GUI the yesterday's, current exchange rates, and the movement based on the difference to be either "UPWARD", "DOWNWARD", or "NO MOVEMENT".

** ### Save to Database

The current rate, difference and the current date will be automatically saved in the database for future statistical data purposes.

** ## Technologies USED **

** ### API **

[Free Currency Converter API](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/)


** ### DATABASE **

SQLITE STUDIO 3

** ### IDE **

Netbeans 14.0
